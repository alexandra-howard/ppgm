Description: This package reconstructs paleoclimate niches using phylogenetic
    comparative methods and projects reconstructed niches onto paleoclimate maps.
    The user can specify various models of trait evolution or estimate the best fit
    model, include fossils, use one or multiple phylogenies for inference, and make
    animations of shifting suitable habitat through time. This model was first used
    in Lawing and Polly (2011) doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028554.
